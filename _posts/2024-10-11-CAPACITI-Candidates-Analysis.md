### **Analysis of CAPACITI Digital Cohort Candidates**

The CAPACITI program is instrumental in addressing South Africa’s digital skills gap by providing training in various digital fields. This analysis examines the performance of the CAPACITI Digital Cohort candidates, focusing on technical and soft skills, program completion rates, and employment outcomes. The goal is to gain insights into candidate development, identify challenges, and understand how these factors impact the success of the cohort.

### **The Project**

The primary objective of this analysis was to evaluate the key performance areas of CAPACITI Digital Cohort candidates, examining their technical, leadership, accountability, and communication skills. The study aimed to answer the following questions:

- What are the demographic profiles of the candidates?
- Which technical skills (Python, Data Analytics, Data Governance) are candidates most and least proficient in?
- How are candidates performing in soft skills like communication, leadership, and project delivery?
- What trends and challenges are present in their learning and development journeys?
- How do these factors influence program completion and post-program employment?

### **Key Insights and Trends**

#### **Data Analytics**
- **Technical and Soft Skill Performance**: Candidates in the Data Analytics track are underperforming in critical areas, with an average score below 3 out of 5 for **communication**, **project delivery**, and **tech skills**. Specifically, 4 candidates have tech scores below 40%. 
- **Notable Low Performers**: **Abigail Thompson**, **Ella Johnson**, **Emma Moore**, **Olivier Miller**, and **William Taylor** are struggling, with tech skills scores below 50%. These gaps suggest a need for additional support in applying technical knowledge and improving communication in project settings.

#### **Data Governance**
- **Low Overall Scores**: Two candidates, **Michael Martinez** and **Samuel Martinez**, have the lowest overall scores of 33%, struggling significantly with both **candidate success manager skills (CSM)** and **tech skills**.
- **At-Risk Candidate**: **Lucas Rodriguez** is considered at risk with an overall score of 53% and a particularly low CSM score of 47%. Additional attention to customer-facing and technical responsibilities could help improve performance.

#### **Python**
- **General Struggles**: Candidates in this track are facing challenges, particularly with **project delivery**, which averages a low score of 2.52. This highlights difficulties in transitioning from learning Python to executing real-world projects.
- **Low Performers**: **Rachel Green** and **Olivier Miller** are both scoring less than 50% overall, and **seven candidates** are underperforming in tech skills, including **William Taylor**, **Charles Davis**, **Aiden Evans**, and **Isabella Jones**. There appears to be a widespread issue with technical mastery in this track.

#### **Challenges**
- **SQL as a Major Hurdle**: SQL is the most commonly reported technical challenge across all tracks, indicating a broad need for enhanced database management and query training.
- **Self-Learning Tools**: Candidates are heavily relying on tools like YouTube, ChatGPT, and Google to solve technical problems, demonstrating resourcefulness but also pointing to gaps in structured support.

### **Tools Used**

- **Power BI**: For preliminary data cleaning and aggregation. For data visualization, exploring candidate progress, skills breakdowns, and performance metrics.

### **Summary**

The CAPACITI Digital Cohort program has made significant strides in developing digital skills among young South Africans, but the data indicates that many candidates struggle with **tech skills**, particularly in **Data Analytics**, **Data Governance**, and **Python** tracks. **Project delivery** and **communication** are recurring weak spots across all tracks, alongside a widespread challenge with **SQL** proficiency. Despite these challenges, the program’s completion and employment rates are strong, suggesting a robust foundation.

### **Recommendations and Applications**

1. **Focused Remediation in Tech Skills**: Implement additional workshops and one-on-one mentorship for candidates in **Data Analytics** and **Python** tracks, with an emphasis on **SQL** mastery and applying technical skills to real-world problems.

2. **Enhancing Soft Skills**: Given the importance of **communication**, **leadership**, and **project delivery** for employment success, introducing dedicated soft skills training modules will be key.

3. **Leveraging Self-Learning Resources**: Encourage candidates to continue using platforms like **YouTube**, **ChatGPT**, and **Google** while integrating these tools into structured learning activities to boost problem-solving skills.

4. **Program Improvement**: By addressing the key areas of weakness identified in this analysis, CAPACITI can further improve employment outcomes, especially in highly technical fields like **Python** and **Data Analytics**.

These insights can be used to guide future program development, better allocate resources for skills training, and ensure that CAPACITI continues to contribute meaningfully to South Africa's digital transformation.
