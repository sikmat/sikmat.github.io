**Impact of Sales Performance Across Countries and Brands**

Understanding sales trends and performance metrics is crucial for driving business decisions and strategies. This analysis focuses on the sales performance of various brands across multiple countries, analyzing key metrics like total sales, profit, units sold, and more. The data visualization presented in the Power BI dashboard offers a clear and concise overview of these metrics, providing insights into the sales landscape.

**The Project**

A big thank you to Anathi Jack, Anati Vato, Buhle Ngqonwa and Siba Njisane for their collaboration on this project! Our goal was to analyze sales data across different brands and countries to uncover patterns and trends that can inform future business strategies. We focused on the following key questions:

- Which brands are driving the most sales and profit?
- How do sales trends vary across different countries?
- What are the seasonal trends in sales performance?
- How do different brands perform in terms of units sold and total sales value?
  
**Key Insights**

Some of the key insights from our analysis include:

- **Sales Performance by Brand:** Ford leads in sales, with a significant margin over other brands like Audi and Isuzu. However, the distribution of sales among brands shows potential growth areas for competitors.
- **Country-Wise Sales:** The United States and Germany lead in sales, while Mexico and France also contribute significantly. Understanding regional performance helps tailor marketing and sales strategies to specific markets.
- **Seasonal Sales Trends:** The majority of sales occur in the earlier months, with a peak in November. This trend suggests that promotional activities and marketing efforts could be aligned with these peak periods to maximize sales.
- **Profit by Country and Brand:** Ford in France and Audi in Germany are leading profit generators. This insight can guide inventory management and promotional efforts to focus on high-profit regions and brands.

**Tools Used**

We utilized a variety of tools to clean, analyze, and visualize the data:

- **Power BI:** For data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.
- **DAX:** For preliminary data cleaning and aggregation.
- **Python:** Writing script for dummy data.

**The Data**

Our analysis focused on the following key areas:

- **Total Sales:** The overall revenue generated across all countries and brands.
- **Total Profit:** The net profit after accounting for costs.
- **Units Sold:** The total number of units sold across all markets.
- **Sales by Country:** Breakdown of sales by country to identify key markets.
- **Sales by Brand:** Analysis of how different brands perform in terms of revenue.
- **Seasonal Sales Trends:** Monthly analysis of sales trends to identify peak periods.
- **Quantity Sold by Quarter:** Quarterly breakdown of sales volume to understand performance over time.

**Summary**

Our analysis revealed that certain brands and countries are driving a significant portion of the sales and profit. Ford, for example, stands out as a leading brand across multiple markets, particularly in France and Germany. The seasonal trends indicate that sales peak towards the end of the year, highlighting the importance of aligning marketing strategies with these periods. Furthermore, the insights gained from the profit analysis can help businesses optimize their focus on high-performing regions and brands.

**Application**

This project has significant implications for business strategy and decision-making. By identifying top-performing brands and markets, companies can allocate resources more effectively, targeting areas with the highest potential for growth. The insights into seasonal trends can inform marketing and promotional activities, ensuring they are timed to maximize impact. Additionally, understanding the profitability of different brands in various markets can guide inventory management and pricing strategies.
