# Airline Analysis

## Project Overview: 
This project delves into a large-scale analysis of airline records, focusing on delays and cancellations. The objective was to explore the following key questions:
- **Which airports require enhanced infrastructure to reduce delays?**
- **How do airline carriers correlate with delays and cancellations?**
- **What are the predominant causes of delays at various airports?**
- **What patterns exist between specific days of the week, times of day, and the incidence of delays and cancellations?**

## Dataset
### Source
The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from Kaggle and contains comprehensive information on flights, airlines, airports, and customer reviews.

### Contents
The dataset includes the following key columns:

- **Flight Number**: Unique identifier for each flight.
- **Airline**: The airline operating the flight.
- **Departure Airport**: The airport from which the flight departs.
- **Arrival Airport**: The airport where the flight arrives.
- **Departure Time**: Scheduled departure time.
- **Arrival Time**: Scheduled arrival time.
- **Flight Duration**: Duration of the flight.
- **Delay**: The amount of delay (if any) in minutes.

## Objective
The primary objectives of this analysis are:
- To assess the on-time performance of various airlines.
- To identify factors contributing to flight delays.
- To provide recommendations for improving airline services based on the findings.

## Analysis
### Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for organizing and executing the analysis.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: For data visualization.

### Steps Undertaken
1. **Data Cleaning**:
- Handling missing values.
- Removing duplicates.
- Correcting data types (e.g., converting date columns to datetime).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
- Visualizing data distributions using histograms and boxplots.
- Analyzing correlations between different features.
- Investigating patterns in delays.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
- Creating new features such as total delay time.
- Categorizing airlines based on performance metrics.
- Creating time-related features like hour of departure to study peak times.

4. **Statistical Analysis**:
- Conducting hypothesis tests to validate findings.
- Calculating summary statistics for key metrics (e.g., average delay time).

5. **Visualization**:
- Creating bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots to represent findings.

## Key Insights:
- **Infrastructure Needs**: Pinpointed airports where infrastructure improvements are most needed, particularly those with frequent carrier and aircraft delays. Enhancing these facilities could significantly reduce delays for passengers.
- **Airline Delay Patterns**: Identified airlines with the highest rates of delayed departures and arrivals, segmented by different delay intervals. This analysis highlights the airlines that may need to focus on improving their timeliness.
- **Delay Causes**: By examining the most common reasons for flight delays by origin airport, state, and airline, the top 10 factors contributing to these delays were identified. This information is critical for making informed decisions on which airports and airlines offer the most reliable service.
- **Optimal Travel Times**: The analysis revealed the best times to travel to minimize the risk of delays, offering valuable insights for passengers planning their flights.


## Real-World Applications:
The analysis has several practical applications:

- **Airport Operations**: Airports identified as having poor performance can use these insights to target specific areas for improvement, which could enhance their reputation and attract more business.
- **Airline Performance Management**: Airlines with high delay rates may need to reconsider their operations to avoid a potential negative impact on their business. Passengers can also use this analysis to make better-informed decisions when choosing airlines.
- **Delay Mitigation**: Our detailed breakdown of delay causes at each airport can help airport authorities implement targeted strategies to reduce delays.
- **Traveler Advice**: Our findings on delay patterns by day of the week and time of day can help travelers plan their flights more effectively, minimizing the likelihood of delays.

- **Cancellation Prediction**: Use of Machine Learning classification models can assist airport authorities in predicting and communicating the reasons for flight cancellations to customers. This proactive approach could help in rerouting flights or providing passengers with timely updates, potentially reducing the negative impact of cancellations.

- **Delay Forecasting**: Development of predictive models can help in providing accurate delay forecasts. These models could be integrated into airline and airport systems, offering passengers more reliable information for planning their journeys.
